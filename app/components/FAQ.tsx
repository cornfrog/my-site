                    <p className="my-answer">
                        In my next role, I'm looking forward to joining a project or company
                        where I can leverage my developer skills while also enhancing my
                        programming abilities. I thrive in environments where I can explore
                        new ideas and share my new findings with my peers for feedback. So,
                        being part of a company that values collaboration and problem-solving
                        as much as I do is very important to me.

                        Why did you decide to change career and/or educational paths?
                        What was your prior path and how did you end up down that road initially?
                    </p>
                    <p className="my-answer">
                        My path prior to this was working in the IT field because helping others
                        solve problems is easily one of my favorite things. However, I ended up
                        noticing that on the job I was primarily being asked to make scripts in
                        order to automate some aspects of my job. After some time, I started
                        relearning some programming fundamentals in other languages like C and
                        C++, but really fell in love with web programming languages because of
                        how it allowed other people to use my software through their browser
                        rather than installing it with the other languages. And since then,
                        I have been hooked!

                        I'd like to start competing in Google's Code Jam or any competitive
                        programming competition, and to start looking for Hackathon groups to join.

                        What has been the most fulfilling aspect of your journey towards becoming a web developer?
                        What's been your biggest challenge and how have you overcome it?
                    </p>
                    <p className="my-answer">
                        The most fulfilling aspect of becoming a web developer is the feeling of
                        being able to show off a potential solution to a problem to your peers.
                        Whether it is the right way or not, developing web applications gives me
                        a "hey, I think I got it!" feeling. Another aspect of web development that
                        I enjoy is its prioritization of other developers to collaborate, and having
                        another person to bounce ideas off is invaluable in my opinion. My biggest
                        challenge has been staying on track when adding a feature to a project. In
                        the past, I was always thinking of what I wanted to add in the future rather
                        than working on what I was supposed to be in the first place. However, through
                        using git for version control to keep feature additions separate, and sites like
                        Trello to help me prioritize which features to add as well as keep track of
                        already implemented features. I can stay way more focused on the task at hand
                        which helps me make actual progress on the project I am working on.

                    <p className="question">
                        If you had an unlimited budget and resources, what would you build?
                    </p>
                    <p className="my-answer">
                        Simple, a Steve Erwin reserve. Iâ€™d build a place where any and all
                        animals can find refuge and anyone can stop by and see them! Not only
                        will this reserve put a spotlight on how important every animal is to
                        the ecosystem, but it will also give people the escape from the 9-5.
                        Imagine! Had a bad day? Go see the elephants! Who can be angry at
                        elephants?! Want to go pet some animals? We have ALL of them! Take a
                        bucket of feed and have a blast! A place like this will help give people
                        the opportunity to learn each animal's role in its ecosystem, but also
                        gives these animals the pampering they deserve. Even the creepy crawling ones!
