                            At Launch, I utilized frameworks like React and Express to
                            integrate into self-made web applications, implemented Test
                            Driven Development methodologies, and collaborated with
                            cohort members on pair programming assignments, employing
                            Agile methodologies and Git workflow for seamless development

                            At Wentworth, I jumped straight into the world of software development,
                            getting my hands dirty with real projects. I tinkered with languages 
                            like Java, C, and C++, collaborating with classmates to build applications 
                            using SCRUM and Agile methods.
